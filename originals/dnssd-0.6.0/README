Background

This represents a Ruby binding to the DNS Service Discovery API published
and open-sourced by Apple Computer.  This should compile with the source
available from the Darwin project, or on OS X Panther systems.  It will 
also compile on Win32 platforms that have installed the Rendezvous for
Windows Technology Preview 2 which can be found here:

http://developer.apple.com/macosx/rendezvous/

To build, simply run:

  $ ruby setup.rb config
  $ ruby setup.rb setup
  # ruby setup.rb install (may require root privilege)

This installs two files, a high level api:

<ruby lib path>/site_ruby/1.8/dnssd.rb

...and a low level native expension:

<ruby lib path>/site_ruby/1.8/powerpc-darwin/rdnssd.so/.dll/.bundle

The dnssd.rb file is what you require:

  require 'dnssd'

...and that loads the rdnssd native extension.  See the ./test
directory for tests that demonstrate using the DNSSD library for
Ruby.
